## Security and Permissions

### Required Microsoft Graph API Permissions

The following Microsoft Graph API permissions are required for full functionality:

| Permission Scope | Purpose | Type |
|-----------------|---------|------|
| `User.Read.All` | Read comprehensive user profiles | Application |
| `User.ReadBasic.All` | Read basic user profile information | Application |
| `Group.Read.All` | Read Microsoft 365 group details | Application |
| `GroupMember.Read.All` | Read group membership information | Application |
| `Presence.Read.All` | Read user presence status in Microsoft Teams | Application |
| `Sites.Read.All` | Read SharePoint site information and permissions | Application |
| `Sites.ReadWrite.All` | Read and write SharePoint site permissions | Application |

### Permission Request Process

1. Deploy the web part solution
2. Navigate to the SharePoint Admin Center
3. Go to "Advanced" > "API Access"
4. Approve the requested Microsoft Graph API permissions

### Security Considerations

- Users will only see group members they have permission to view
- Respects existing SharePoint and Microsoft 365 group access controls
- Permissions are scoped to read-only access

## Known Limitations

- Performance may vary with large group memberships
- Profile photo retrieval depends on user's Microsoft 365 profile

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure proper Microsoft Graph API permissions
- Verify network connectivity
- Check browser console for specific error messages
